== levels ==
Level are loaded/save by steel itself, not weld, to get the 'save modifications you made on the level' feature available at low cost.
Since one level is edited at a time, there's no need for a 'save all' option, so the single level design is okay.
Weld just saves what level was last loaded, so that it can request an automatic reloading at startup.
Level's info transits through the QSteelWidget, so that weld knows stuff about steel, without actually holding any info critical to steel.

== Behavior Trees ==
The BT system works in a different way than , because even if it would be cool to be able to save modifications done to them, it would be too much work on the c++ side.
The way it works is the following:
	- one builds a BT with any available file browser,
	- one asks weld to export it (triggers a filesystem to json translation)
	- weld then requests steel to (re)load it
At startup, steel has a list of BT's it can use. At level loading, agents ask steel to instanciate their BT.

BTrees are exported engine-wise, so that different levels can use same ones at no cost.
